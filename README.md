# 🎓 Sono Optics Thesis – Optical and Acoustic Levitation

This repository contains the Jupyter Notebook `Sono_Optics_Thesis.ipynb`, which documents key results and analysis from my undergraduate Physics thesis project.

## 📍 Project Overview

The work explores the interaction between sound and an **opticaly levitated particl**. Specifically, the levitated particle is used to measure the forces generated by an acoustic levitator.

The main goals of the project were:

- To validate experimental data against theoretical models of spherical scattering.
- ...

## 🧪 Experimental Work

The experimental setup and data collection were carried out at the **Optical Levitation Laboratory** at the **University of Gothenburg**, in Sweden 🇸🇪. The system allowed for the levitation of micrometer-sized silica particles using an optical levitation trap, basically composed of a focused vertical laser beam.

## 📊 Notebook Contents

The Jupyter notebook includes:

- Raw data exploration and processing.
...
- Final conclusions and plots used in the thesis
