# 🎓 Sono Optics Thesis – Acoustic Levitation and Light Scattering

This repository contains the Jupyter Notebook `Sono_Optics_Thesis.ipynb`, which documents key results and analysis from my undergraduate Physics thesis project.

## 📍 Project Overview

The work explores the interaction between sound and light in the context of **acoustically levitated droplets**. Specifically, it focuses on how laser light scatters off droplets held in place using standing ultrasonic waves — a setup that enables contactless optical measurements of liquid systems in air.

The main goals of the project were:

- To study **Mie scattering patterns** produced by levitated water droplets
- To determine droplet size and stability using **image analysis and light scattering theory**
- To validate experimental data against theoretical models of spherical scattering

## 🧪 Experimental Work

The experimental setup and data collection were carried out at the **Optical Levitation Laboratory** at the **University of Gothenburg**, Sweden. The system allowed for the levitation of microliter-sized water droplets using ultrasound and real-time laser probing of their optical properties.
